TESTING:

Take the given Python file. Analyze the functions provided and determine what inputs could possibly cause a function to crash. Additionally, what would you expect given a possible input? All of the functions (except greetUser) have at least two distinct ways an input could crash the function. This could be due to data type or it could be due to the actual value of the variable. Once you have a correct input, you also need to verify correct things are being done with the input.

So, for instance, with greetUser, while the program won't crash, how can you test that it's working correctly?

Generate a separate Python file with tests for each of the Python functions. Each function should have THREE tests AT MINIMUM. However, you'll need 30 tests at minimum for the project as a whole. So, some functions may get more than the required 3 tests.

(** Keep in mind, you don't have to test every part of a function. If you're testing for functionality, you don't necessarily always have to test for correct outputs at that time.)

 

CORRECTING:

At this point: you should have some (many) failures. Correct your Python file! Can certain tests be passed with Try/Except blocks? Is it due to input conversion? Math? Wrong values? Certain tests in here can be easily passed with a little tweaking.

** Note! greetUser in the comments says it wants to only accept names that are all letters. You should address this!

 

DOCUMENTATION:

While testing/correcting, keep track of what you're doing. For each function, write a few things that you think you should test. What inputs would you then use to test? List these inputs. For corrections to the Python file: document what changes you're applying. Why did you make these changes? What tests originally failed that now pass?

Additionally, do you have any tests that are meant to fail? Why are these meant to fail? What are they?
